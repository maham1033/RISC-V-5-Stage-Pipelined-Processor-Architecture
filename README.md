# RISC-V 5-Stage Pipelined Processor

## About the Project
This project is a **RISC-V 5-Stage Pipelined Processor** built to show how a processor can execute instructions more efficiently by dividing the work into different stages. The processor uses a pipeline, which allows it to process multiple instructions at the same time by splitting them into 5 stages: Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execution, Memory Access, and Write Back.

## Key Features
- **5-Stage Pipeline:** The processor is divided into 5 stages: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write Back. Each stage handles part of an instruction.
- **Parallel Processing:** The processor can handle multiple instructions at once, speeding up performance.
- **RISC-V Instructions:** The project supports a basic set of RISC-V instructions, including:
  - **Arithmetic Instructions:** ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc.
  - **Load/Store Instructions:** Load and store data from memory.
  - **Branch Instructions:** Conditional branches (e.g., BEQ, BNE).
- **Memory Access:** Supports both reading from and writing to memory.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, get a copy of the project by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EbaaHaq/RISC-V-5-Stage-Pipelined-Processor.git
cd RISC-V-5-Stage-Pipelined-Processor
```

### 2. Open the Project
Open the project in **VSCode** or any editor of your choice. Make sure you have the necessary extensions installed to work with **SystemVerilog**.

### 3. Compile the Code
Use this command to compile the design files:

```bash
vlog *.sv
```

### 4. Run the Simulation
Run the simulation with this command:

```bash
vsim -c tb_processor -voptargs=+acc -do "run -all"
```

### 5. View the Simulation Waveform
After running the simulation, you can view the results using **GTKWave**:

```bash
gtkwave processor.vcd
```

This will open a graphical waveform viewer where you can see the processor's activity over time.

## What’s Inside the Processor

### Pipeline Stages
The processor works by breaking each instruction into five steps:
1. **Instruction Fetch (IF):** Get the instruction from memory.
2. **Instruction Decode (ID):** Figure out what the instruction is and prepare the needed data.
3. **Execution (EX):** Perform the actual operation (like adding numbers or comparing values).
4. **Memory Access (MEM):** Read or write data from/to memory.
5. **Write Back (WB):** Write the result back to the register file.

### Supported Instructions
The processor supports the basic RISC-V instructions, such as:
- **Arithmetic:** ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR
- **Load/Store:** LW, SW, etc.
- **Branch:** BEQ, BNE, BLT, etc.
- **Jump:** JAL, JALR

## How It Helps You Learn
This project is perfect for understanding how a processor works, especially how it uses a pipeline to speed up the execution of instructions. It’s a great starting point for anyone learning about computer architecture or pipelined processors.
